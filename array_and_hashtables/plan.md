## Pre-requisite

Understand 2-dimensional arrays: Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTNpiLUSiB4)



## Exercise 1: 

String compression (Problem 1.6 in "Cracking the Coding Interview")

Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.  For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string.  You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z).  




## Exercise 2: 

Zero matrix (Problem 1.8 in CCI).   

Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.
