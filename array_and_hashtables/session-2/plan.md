# Session Plan

## Level 1 Exercises 

1. String Compression (Exercise 1.6) in "Cracking the Coding Interview" (CCI)

Implement a method a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.  For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3.  If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string.  You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z). 


1. URLify (Exercise 1.3) in CCI

Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.  You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)

For Level 1, don't worry about performing the operation "in place".  You can construct a brand new string.  


## Level 2 Exercises 
1. URLify (Exercise 1.3) in CCI

Do the URLify exercise from Level 1, but perform the operation "in place".  You cannot construct a brand new string.  Use a character array to represent your string.  

1. String Rotation (Exercise 1.9) in CCI

Assume you have a method "isSubstring" which checks if one word is a substring of another.  Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to "isSubstring" (e.g., "watterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat").
